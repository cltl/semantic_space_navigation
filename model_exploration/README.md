# Space exploration

All you need to inspect an existing space. Functions for loading the space, as well as basic measure functions like cosine are in the utils.py file.

* test_model.py will test space loading: loads a space and calculates a cosine on predetermined words. For example, call with:

`python ./test_model.py ../models/EN-wform.w.5.cbow.neg10.400.subsmpl.top1000.txt`
