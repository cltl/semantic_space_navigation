,Will a classifier outperform nearest neighbors?,concepts captured by a classifier (and not nearest neighbors),Concepts not learned because we expect too little evidence
is_animal,yes,polysemous words (in particular animal – food),"polysemous words predominantly used in the food sense, e.g. chicken, shrimp, lobster)"
is_food,yes,"polysemous words (in particular animal – food), most likely captured","not captured: polysemous words with very skewed sense distribution towards animal senses (e.g. game, alligator)"
is_dangerous,yes,"words that are not in the majority category (I think most are weapons, but I expect the classifier to learn dangerous animals)","things that can be dangerous but are harmless in most contexts (e.g. razor, "
does_kill,yes,"words that are not in the majority category (I think most are weapons, but I expect the classifier to learn dangerous animals)","things that could theoretically kill but have a different primary function or use, e.g. alcohol"
has_wheels,yes,"less typical vehicles that have wheel-behavior (e.g. carriage, wheelchair) and recognize negative examples that are vehicles, but do not have wheels (e.g. boat, helicopter, sledge)",things that have wheels but do not engage in typical wheel-behavior (e.g. ferris wheel)
is_black,no,"I expect the classifier to learn the majority classes of things included as positive examples, possibly animals. There are words that frequently collocate with black (e.g. black dress, black shirt, black tie), but I do not expect a single word to be enough evidence for a property, in particular considering that other categories are probably more dominant (e.g. clothes, animals)","cannot distinguish negative examples from positive examples in the majority categories, does not recognize positive examples from underrepresented categories"
is_found_in_seas,yes,"polysemous words (in particular animal – food), words that are not in the majority class (probably non-animals, such as boat, submarine, scuba diver)","polysemous words predominately used in the food senses (e.g. shrimp, scallops, squid)"
is_long,,,
is_red,no,Probably learns majority classes and may outperform nearest neighbors for these classes (since it is not tied to a single centroid),"things not in the majority class, negative examples in the majority class"
is_used_in_cooking,yes,centroid is probably somewhere between different food categories and something like tools or devices. I expect a classifier to be able to distinguish between cooking utensils and other tools ,"probably cannot distinguish between things that are used and things that are produced (e.g. cake, pizza, sandwich) (evidence might be too subtle for a absolute windows and bow approach)"
is_warm,yes,,
is_yellow,no,"Classifier may learn overrepresented categories better than nearest neighbors, e.g. typically yellow fruits, flowers or animals ","cannot distinguish negative examples from positive examples in the overrepresented categories, does not learn things in the underrepresented categories"
made_of_wood,no ,may learn overrepresented category such as furniture,"cannot distinguish negative from positive examples in the majority category (e.g. sofa), does not learn underrepresented categories "
