,Will a classifier outperform nearest neighbors?,concepts captured by a classifier (and not nearest neighbors),Concepts not learned because we expect too little evidence
is_animal,"y: though nearest neighbors will presumably do well (high similarity), there are specific context that will, at least, allow classifiers to pick up animal meaning of polysemous instances",mainly ambiguous ones (food/animal category; possibly kiwi),locust: polysemous word referring to atypical animal 
is_food,"y: nearest neighbor will miss things that are eaten, but can also not be seen as food; classifiers will pick these up (animal/food polysemy)","animal/food polysemy will be picked up by classifier, possibly not by nearest neighbor","things that can be food, but are only in specific cultures: for now these are excluded"
is_dangerous,"p: things for which being dangerous is a highly prominent feature will not necessarily be similar (e.g. guns, wild animals), but fear and warning may lead to enough contextual indication. On the other hand, many things can be dangerous, but would not be seen as such (e.g. glass if it is broken, ladders if not proper security measures)","expect to work well for inherently dangerous things (guns, wild animals), possibly also things that can be dangerous depending on context (glass, ladder): interesting for the 3-fold classification","anything outside of weapon/animal class; drugs medice would possibly work, but not with our corpus"
does_kill,"p: partially as for danger; there will also be the direct expression of 'killed by', but I am not sure whether this specific context will be enough.","wild animals, weapons can work, things that rarely kill probably not. Also not clear whether killing humans is distinguished from killing other animals (both in gold and in outcome model).","here examples of animals that kill other animals, but not humans are likely to go wrong: the corpus (not using more complex structures, word order) will mark that it kills (assuming the verb itself is enough), but not what it kills. Possibly the word `prey' may help distinguish, but than animals that do kill people also capture prey."
has_wheels,"n: wheels roll and are turned, only rolling is exclusive for wheels and dice. If one context is enough for learning this distinction, wheels on vehicles will be distinguished better by classifiers than similarity, but not steering wheels.",as explained: depends on few context enough to learn and how far skateboards are from cars: do not expect superior performance.,things that only have steering wheels or wheels that are used for operating them.
is_black,"n: in principle, we do not expect that are generally black things will be labelled or referred to differently from non-black things","p: extremely poor performance expected by nearest neighbor, classifier will not do much better, but slightly better due to collocations for specifically typically black animals. I expect this to be a bit more the case for black, where typically black things are often labelled black (see other colors).",nothing to add to original description
is_found_in_seas,n: context is unlikely to find information separating aquatic animals or plants living only in sweet water from those who can also live in sea water. There is also no reason to expect direct context of objects found in seas to be similar to animals and plants. ,no further specifications,nothing to add to original description
is_long,,,
is_red,n: neither neighbors nor classifiers will have the information to distinguish red things from non-red things,"will not have the same collocations as black for animals, but possibly within the fruit class it will work (red fruits); it will then presumably not include tomato (typically not meant when referring to the red fruits)",nothing to add.
is_used_in_cooking,"y: depending on settings and hyperparameters, classifiers may pick up `recipe language'","can probably classify food used in cooking and utensils; maybe it manages to find them both, but not aprons ",nothing to add to original description
is_warm,,,
is_yellow,n: neither neighbors nor classifiers will have the information to distinguish yellow things from non-yellow things,not aware of subcategories of yellow things as may exist for black and red,nothing to add to original description
made_of_wood,p: context about creating wood objects and specific wood specifications may indicate the material for diverse objects.,"furniture and components of buildings may be found, not ship, rafts, paper etc. (or these will not be learnable from one to the other) ",nothing to add.
