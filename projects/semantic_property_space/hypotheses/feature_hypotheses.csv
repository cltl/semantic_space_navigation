is_red	y	l	n						
is_fast	y	m	y	diverse things	 but likely to be made explicit (possibly only for very fast things though: e.g. jaguar	 sports car	 yes	 wolf no)	
is_a_fruit	y	h	y (ps)						
is_long	n	l	n	not expected to have an impact on interaction in most cases (shape meaning)					
is_black	y	l	n						
has_a_point	y	l	for some	having a sharp point can be related to function or also injuring					
does_lay_eggs	y	h	y						
does_live_in_water	y	m	y	expect the environment to be important for the non-fish	 talk about eco-system will also make this a topic mentioned for fish itself				
is_electric	y	h	y	difficult class: many things can be					
has_eyes	n	h	y	literal meaning	 other meaning to test later				
is_yellow	y	l	n						
is_warm	y	l	depends on meaning: generic: no	 keeping warm: yes	clothes	 drinks	 heating	 blanket: diverse	 but context will possibly give this away
is_hard	n	m	for some	complex class					
has_flesh	n	m	y	yes for typical ones	 but otherwise difficult to distinguish from learning taxonomic groups.				
is_useful	n	l	if literal: yes	 otherwise: no	can pick up that something is a tool	 but subjective component is difficult: data also likely to be polluted by this.			
has_teeth	n	h	y	tooth related activities (bite	 etc.)	 not sure if other teeth (mechanical) should be taken into consideration			
has_an_engine	y	h	y						
is_played_does_play	n	h	depends on meaning: if double meaning: for some	 otherwise yes	instruments and toys: yes	 beings that play is another class. People may also differ in their judgement. It could learn instruments	 toys and young animals	 the word `play' itself is likely to occur in context for all  (possibly less for the animals though).	
made_of_wood	y	m	n	being made of wood is not likely to be relevant or influence how people talk about things across the wide variety of objects					
is_grown	n	h	y						
does_eat	y	h	y						
is_healthy	n	m	y	sports and certain food. Likely to capture specific foods	 possibly sports in general	 good sleep	 but not specific sports linked to food		
has_wings	y	h	y	difficult to test	 since high correlation with things that fly: do not expect it to capture the helicopter	 but possibly non-flying birds.			
does_kill	n	m	y	animals and weapons: 2 subgroups: possibly captured because of danger	 warnings or even directly kill/death				
is_juicy	n	h	y	mainly fruits	 some other foods				
is_colourful	n	l	n	animals and weapons: 2 subgroups: possibly captured because of danger					
has_skin_peel	y	m	n	if this is supposed to be both skin and peel (of animals and fruit), it will not be captured in the same way: they are not presented by the same dimensions					
does_grow	y	m	y	expected to have expression around farming, etc.					
has_skin	n	h	n	very few specific properties, if so, correlating with similarity (no capturing polysemy beyond that)					
is_noisy_loud	n	l	no	I expect it to be difficult to distinguish noisy from sound (you hear helicopters, motorcycles, but also birds (generally not noisy) and music (can be loud or noisy, but is not always) 					
is_for_children	n	m	y, partially	toys, pets typically for children will be captured, but possibly not products that parents use.					
does_make_music	n	h	depends	if only tools, etc: probably yes (play music), persons, animals that sing, probably not in the same class
