Taxonomic cateogries with polysemous examples
-----

General remarks: It is hard to find a category with more than just one or two polysemous examples. We could try to use wordnet to extend the number of polysemous examples, but Wordnet polysemy might be too fine-grained. 

Expectation: Nearest neighbors does not recognize polysemous examples, supervised approaches do

> is_a_bird: crane (bird - tool) 
> is_found_in_seas: animal - food (not a real taxonomic category, very close)
> is_animal: possible (boring) way of testing animal - food polysemy. We do have previous work on this we can cite though (clustering approach vs another similarity-based approach)

----
Expected learnability of important/relevant/defining features
----

Expectation: Features that have an impact on the way entities interact in the world are well captured by embeddings. For some cases, specific features are captured allowing us to make fine-grained distinctions with classification that are not possible with similarity. 

> is_dangerous: diverse group of things that should all share some sort of danger/threat/death/injury/fear context
> does_kill: similar to is_dangerous
> has_wheels: vehicles with wheels behave differently and are found in different situations than vehicles without wheels


----
No learnalbility
----

Expectation: Features that are not relevant for the way entities interact with the world are not learnable.
