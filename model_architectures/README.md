* word2vec_c adaptation

The word2vec implementation allows you to select a specific initialization. This option is provided to replicate previous experiments and try out variations in settings while controling for the initialization.
The code is an adaptation of Omer Levy and Yoav Goldberg used in the following paper:

"Dependency-Based Word Embeddings". Omer Levy and Yoav Goldberg. ACL 2014.

The adaptations were implemented by Minh Le.
